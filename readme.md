# Homeserver Tips
Here I want to share my experience of setting up a homeserver with you. I also want to share the problems I've encountered and how I fixed them.

## My Setup
I built my Server out of 2 old hp work stations. Now it has:
 - 32 GB RAM (DDR4)
 - an intel i7 7th gen
 - 1 SSD as boot drive (225GB)
 - 1 HDD as storage drive (1TB)
 
As base OS I've installed proxmox and inside of proxmox I've installed TrueNAS and home assistant.
